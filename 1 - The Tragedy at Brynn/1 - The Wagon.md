# 1 - The Wagon
*You cannot remember when it had last stopped raining. In sheets so thick it poors, barely 10 feet beyond the edge of the road is visible from between the soaked canvas flaps of the rickety, jostling covered wagon in which you currently ride. Neither sun, nor moon, nor stars are visible through the low hanging clouds, and the hills and trees are obscured by the constant march of rolling fog banks.*
*You do not ride alone. Refugees, nomads, vagrants - souls without homes - some now even without nations accompany you on a journey south that even for you has no clear destination. The features of your fellow occupents are hidden by the dark of the enclosure, in their hands they clutch the only few possessions they have, but the degree to which they cling to life seems to you to be waning.  From one rider however, you perceive a certain liveliness. Certainly no boistrous joie de vivre, but a definite purposefulness. He sits close to the end of the wagon, his back turned to you, his faced pointed down and out to the road, which has now become a shallow sea of still rising rain water. From around the side of his torso, you see him resting his hand on his right thigh, his thumb slowly rubbing small circles against the back of a small gold pendant. He wears the regimental forest green uniform of the Proskur 5th Infrantry. Though threadbare in places, its buttons have been recently polished a bright brass.*
*Perhaps sensing your curious attention, he turns slowly to acknowledge you. He man may be in fact still quite young, no older than 24 or 26, but his features seem prematurely aged. He smiles as he meets your gaze, loose waves of brown hair with thin strands of grey framing the sides of a warm face. Immediately however you notice that he meets your eyes not with his own: a bandage of thin cotton covers his face between the bridge of his nose and his forehead, with fading red scars visible at the top and bottom edges of the cloth.*
Ardin Willowbraid will volunteer information readily when asked. He will begin by relating events of the recent border skirmish between Brost and Dar'kva. He will then proceed to tell the adventurer seated next to him about his small family. At the conclusion of the conversation, the wagon will be attacked by the nomadic goblin raiding party.
```
The Brost 5th and 6th infantries were sent from Pröskur to secure the border with Dar'kva to the north. We marched through the Ishim-Shevo the to plains of Ishim where we met 3 Dar'kva battalions accompanied by a Norishtrelko Augmentary. Myself and 3 others in my company were taken unaware by the searing light of an Augmentary Svorsevaar. I lost my sight immediately. The skirmish was costly for both sides. Brost and Dar'kva called the armistice shortly after.
```      
Ardin takes a deep breath, a light hope returns to his voice,
```
But these wars are over for me. I'm returning now to my hometown, the small village of Brynn just off the road to Proskur, settled in the foothills of the Weßell mountains. I'll return there to my wife,
```
Ardin shows a small locket, 
```
Ellaina...
```
He opens and holds it out to you, revealing a tiny daguerreotype photo of a charming new family. A handsome young man with dark hair stands behind a fair woman of surpassing beauty, with light flaxen hair that flows like long ocean waves down the length of her back, seated on a simple wooden chair with her left hand risen to meet his resting on her shoulder. 
```
My darling wife. Even tough I can no longer see her picture, her face is still clear in my mind.
```
In her other arm, she holds a small child, a wide-eyed, curly-haired bundle. He points to his son in the photo,
```
Peter turned one two month ago.
```
Ardin grins, then looks out the wagon,
```
I'll be disembarking soon, the path to Brynn should be near...
``` 
With a violent lurch and the wounded groan of its horse, the wagon comes to a sudden halt. The other riders of the wagon bury their heads in their hands or knees; a crossbow bolt pierces through the canvas before embedding itself squarely in the throat of one of the riders. The howling of goblins can be heard outside.
