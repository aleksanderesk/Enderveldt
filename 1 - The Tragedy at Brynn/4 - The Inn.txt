                                  4 - The Inn
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Building 7:
    An early night has come to the village as you approach the Inn. The lights of
    its upper floor are lit, and indistinct voices in goblinoid can be heard as well
    as the grunts of a particularly large and likely somewhat inebriated bugbear. 
    {Spot, vs goblin's hide} A goblin cowers underneath one of the inn's beds. 
    [Speaks only goblinoid] Will explain that the goblins were wandering west
    from down the slopes of We√üell. Everything here has been, strange. Some of
    us pleaded with Tusk to leave here, some of us, saw.. something.. standing,
    in the water, far in the distance, dark, dirty.

    The wind begins to howl outside the inn, accompanied by violent thunder
    claps. The rafters shudder and shake, and the eyes of the goblin prisoner
    dart back and forth with frenzied anxiety. Without stars or moon, the
    darkness outside is totalizing. Only the brief lightning flashes reveal any
    part of the village. 
    {Spot, DC 13} Underneath the overhang of a southerly house, stands a lonely
    figure, wearing a sullen, stained, and tattered dress. Its face is obscurred
    by mud dirtied hair, caked with soggy leaves, and punctered with twigs. Its
    arms hang limply at its side and its hands end in gruesome, cracked, and 
    bloodied claws. As quickly as you saw it, it disappears in the enveloping
    darkness.
